    description: "The second generation Audi A1 was launched in mid-June 2018 and began production in October 2018, exclusive to the five-door Sportback configuration. Built on the Volkswagen Group MQB A0 platform (shared with Volkswagen Polo Mk6 and SEAT Ibiza Mk5), it grew in size compared to its predecessor. It features a more aggressive design with styling cues inspired by the original Quattro rally car. The interior received Audi's latest technology including the Virtual Cockpit digital instrument display and improved infotainment systems. Engine options include 1.0L, 1.5L, and 2.0L TFSI petrol engines, with no diesel options offered. This generation focuses more on connectivity, technology, and sportier design while maintaining premium quality in the small car segment. Audi announced the A1 will be discontinued without a successor once this generation's lifecycle ends."
